​​1. Project Description

1.1. Overview

Rentezzy allows a customer to search and rent property in Ireland.​ This platform has 3 types of users - customer, owner and agent. Owner and agent can add property to be rented. Agent has to have a subscription for posting properties and in turn can earn commission out of it, whereas the owner can sign up and add property available for rent. Customers will be able to book and also cancel the booking after a certain amount of time. Rentezzy also allows users to get details of the property location from important stores, transportation, etc.

1.2. Business scenario

We are required to deliver a system that allows how a customer may search for a property and book property for rent. The system checks the desired properties from the database based on counties and provides results to the customer. Also we have agents as another user of this system where they can add property that is available for rent. Agents can get commission based on properties that are booked amongst the listed ones. Agents can be promoted to gold and platinum based on the properties rented that are listed.
